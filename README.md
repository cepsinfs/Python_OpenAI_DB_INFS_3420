# README for Python Notebooks Repository

## Overview

Welcome to the **Python Notebooks Repository**! This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks designed to help you understand fundamental and advanced concepts in **Python programming**, **Database handling**, and **Text & Sentiment Analysis**. Whether you're new to Python or looking to sharpen your data analysis skills, this collection will serve as a practical guide for learning and applying key concepts.

## Repository Contents

### 1. Python Concepts
This section includes notebooks that cover basic to intermediate Python programming topics. These notebooks will help you understand how Python works and how to implement common programming tasks.
- **Topics Covered:**
  - Data types (strings, lists, dictionaries, tuples)
  - Conditional statements and loops
  - Functions and lambda expressions
  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python
  - Error handling and debugging
  - Working with external libraries and modules

### 2. Database Handling Concepts
Learn how to interact with databases using Python. These notebooks cover basic database management using SQL and also explore more advanced concepts such as connecting Python to databases and performing CRUD operations.
- **Topics Covered:**
  - SQL Basics (queries, joins, aggregations)
  - Connecting to a database using `sqlite3`, `MySQL`, or `PostgreSQL`
  - Performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations
  - Using Python's `SQLAlchemy` ORM for database management
  - Data extraction and manipulation using Python and SQL

### 3. Text and Sentiment Analysis
This section focuses on the preprocessing, analysis, and interpretation of textual data. It also delves into sentiment analysis techniques using various natural language processing (NLP) tools.
- **Topics Covered:**
  - Text preprocessing (tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, stopword removal)
  - Bag of Words (BoW) and TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)
  - Sentiment analysis using libraries like `NLTK`, `TextBlob`, and `VADER`
  - Analyzing social media text (Twitter data) for sentiment
  - Machine learning-based sentiment analysis using `scikit-learn`
